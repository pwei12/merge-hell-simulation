There’s a right way to ask for help. Everybody needs to ask for help at some point. And when you do, make sure that you do these 4 things:
- Overcommunicate details that you see.
- Explain exactly what you think should be happening.
- Explain exactly what is actually happening.
- Explain why you think it should be working differently.
- When you go through this process, you’ll often come across a solution without ever asking for help. It makes you think about problems in a holistic way.


It’s ok to make big mistakes. I once made a mistake that cost my company $10,000 dollars. In the process, I learned the most important lesson of my programming career.
