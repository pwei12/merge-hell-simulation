Programming is about using the right tool for the job. There are so many different open source libraries, tools, and frameworks at your disposal. So you need to grow your developer toolkit and understand which tool makes sense for each problem that they encounter.

There’s a right way to ask for help. Everybody needs to ask for help at some point. And when you do, make sure that you do these 4 things:
- Overcommunicate details that you see.
- Explain exactly what you think should be happening.
- Explain exactly what is actually happening.
- Explain why you think it should be working differently.
- When you go through this process, you’ll often come across a solution without ever asking for help. It makes you think about problems in a holistic way.

You’re going to wake up in the morning thinking about code. And when it happens, it’s really freakin’ cool.
